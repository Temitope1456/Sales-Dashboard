### INTRODUCTION:
Data cleaning and manipulation were carried out on the dataset. I ensured I corrected inconsistent data, handled missing Values and used the TRIM function to remove unnecessary spaces as leading and trailing spaces in text can cause issues. Once my dataset has been properly cleaned I proceeded to data visualization.

### OBJECTIVES:
The provided data offers insights into the revenue and sales performance of the company over two fiscal years, FY 2018 and FY 2019. Letâ€™s analyze these insights and provide explanations for each observation:

### FINDINGS
1. Total Revenue by Cities:
- Texas: $532k
- New Mexico: $492k
- California: $508k
- Arizona: $495k
The distribution of revenue by cities indicates that the company has a significant presence and customer base in these states, with Texas, California, and New Mexico contributing the most to the revenue.

2. Total Revenue and Sales:
- Total Revenue Generated: $2.08 million
- Total Products Sold: 9,119
- Total Customers: 20
In FY 2018, the company sold 5,259 products, generating $1.1 million in revenue. However, in FY 2019, both the number of products sold (3,860) and revenue ($870k) decreased. This suggests a decline in sales performance between the two fiscal years.

3. Products by Revenue:
Top 5 Products by Revenue:
- Item 1: $737k
- Item 5: $500k
- Item 2: $366k
- Item 4: $301k
- Item 3: $125k
These products are the highest revenue generators for the company. Focusing on marketing and optimizing these products can help maintain and increase revenue.

4. Top Companies by Revenue:
Top Companies by Revenue: Company S, Company N, Company J, Company C, and Company D
These companies have generated the most revenue, indicating strong partnerships or consistent business relationships.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
- Analyze the product portfolio to understand why certain products are underperforming. Consider discontinuing or rebranding low-performing products and invest in marketing and innovation for high-performing ones.
- Given the revenue distribution across states, consider expanding operations or marketing efforts in regions with untapped potential, such as Arizona.
- Nurture and strengthen relationships with top revenue-generating companies to ensure consistent and mutually beneficial partnerships.
