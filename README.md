Data cleaning and manipulation were carried out on the dataset. I ensured I corrected inconsistent data, handled missing Values and used the TRIM function to remove unnecessary spaces as leading and trailing spaces in text can cause issues. Once my dataset has been properly cleaned I proceeded to data visualization.

Analysis

The provided data offers insights into the revenue and sales performance of the company over two fiscal years, FY 2018 and FY 2019. Let’s analyze these insights and provide explanations for each observation:

1. Total Revenue by Cities:

Texas: $532k
New Mexico: $492k
California: $508k
Arizona: $495k
The distribution of revenue by cities indicates that the company has a significant presence and customer base in these states, with Texas, California, and New Mexico contributing the most to the revenue.

2. Total Revenue and Sales:

Total Revenue Generated: $2.08 million
Total Products Sold: 9,119
Total Customers: 20
In FY 2018, the company sold 5,259 products, generating $1.1 million in revenue. However, in FY 2019, both the number of products sold (3,860) and revenue ($870k) decreased. This suggests a decline in sales performance between the two fiscal years.

3. Revenue by Half-Year Periods:

H1 2018 Revenue: $606k
H2 2018 Revenue: $551k
H1 2019 Revenue: $589k
H2 2019 Revenue: $280k
The revenue analysis by half-year periods shows fluctuations in revenue. There was a dip in H2 2019 compared to H2 2018, indicating a potential issue in the latter half of FY 2019.

Top 5 Products by Revenue:
Item 1: $737k
Item 5: $500k
Item 2: $366k
Item 4: $301k
Item 3: $125k
These products are the highest revenue generators for the company. Focusing on marketing and optimizing these products can help maintain and increase revenue.

5. Top Companies by Revenue:

Top Companies by Revenue: Company S, Company N, Company J, Company C, and Company D
These companies have generated the most revenue, indicating strong partnerships or consistent business relationships.

Recommendations for Revenue and Sales Improvement:

Product Mix Optimization: Analyze the product portfolio to understand why certain products are underperforming. Consider discontinuing or rebranding low-performing products and invest in marketing and innovation for high-performing ones.
Customer Expansion: To mitigate the decline in customers from FY 2018 to FY 2019, focus on acquiring new customers through targeted marketing campaigns and customer acquisition strategies.
Half-Year Performance Analysis: Investigate the significant drop in revenue in H2 2019 compared to H2 2018. Identify the root causes, whether it’s market conditions, operational issues, or other factors, and develop strategies to address them.
Regional Focus: Given the revenue distribution across states, consider expanding operations or marketing efforts in regions with untapped potential, such as Arizona.
Partnership Strengthening: Nurture and strengthen relationships with top revenue-generating companies to ensure consistent and mutually beneficial partnerships.
Implementing these recommendations can help the company address revenue and sales challenges, optimize its product offerings, and achieve growth and sustainability in the coming fiscal years
